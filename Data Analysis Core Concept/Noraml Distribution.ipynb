    "# Noraml Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "A Normal Distribution (also called Gaussian Distribution) is a type of continuous probability distribution where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data points are clustered around the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Fewer values appear as you move away from the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph forms a smooth, symmetric bell-shaped curve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "1️. Bell-Shaped Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve is highest at the mean and decreases on both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️. Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side and right side of the curve are mirror images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️. Mean = Median = Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "All three are equal and located at the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️. Most Data Lies Near the Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About:\n",
    "\n",
    "68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation (σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "95% within 2σ\n",
    "\n",
    "99.7% within 3σ\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the 68-95-99.7 Rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "5️. Defined by Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ) → center of the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ) → spread of the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of people, exam scores, and measurement errors often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary (Short Notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped curve where most values cluster around the mean, and data spreads based on standard deviation."
